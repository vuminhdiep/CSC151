 *
 *CLASS INVARIANTS (From the bottom page 150 in textbook):
 *
 * Our suggested design for the sequence ADT has three private instance variables.
 * The first variable, data, is an array that stores the elements of the sequence. Just
 * like the bag, data is a partially filled array, and a second instance variable,
 * called manyItems, keeps track of how much of the data array is currently
 * being used. Therefore, the used part of the array extends from data[0] to
 * data[manyItems-1]. The third instance variable, currentIndex, gives the
 * index of the current element in the array (if there is one). Sometimes a sequence
 * has no current element, in which case currentIndex will be set to the same
 * number as manyItems (since this is larger than any valid index). The complete
 * invariant of our ADT is stated as three rules:
 *
 * 1. The number of elements in the sequence is stored in the instance variable
 * manyItems.
 *
 * 2. For an empty sequence (with no elements), we do not care what is stored
 * in any of data; for a nonempty sequence, the elements of the sequence
 * are stored from the front to the end in data[0] to data[manyItems-1],
 * and we donâ€™t care what is stored in the rest of data.
 *
 * 3. If there is a current element, then it lies in data[currentIndex]; if there
 * is no current element, then currentIndex equals manyItems.
 *
 * if currentIndex < 0 or currentIndex >= manyItems, then the sequence doesn't have current element.
 * By default, we indicate that currentIndex = manyItems means there is no current element
